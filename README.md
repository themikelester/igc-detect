# Detect launches and landings in paragliding tracklogs (.igc files)

This tool analyzes one or more .igc files and outputs all detected landing locations as a .gpx file. It is assumed that the track is from a paraglider, as average flying speed is used in the launch detection. The output can then be imported into a mapping tool such as Gaia for finding nearby potential takeoffs.
